# CT_IBM
 Individual-based, stochastic, dynamic network model of sexually transmitted infections

The CT_IBM_2021 class is an adaptation of the original code for the dynamics of gonorrhea with two strains in a network of men having sex with men (MSM). 
In this new version, a strictly heterosexual network considered. Mainly, the network was changaed into a bipartite one. And the model was adapted to 
simulate targeted scenarios on a sexually active heterosexual pupolation, with the precence of a single strain of chlamydia and a single option of drug therapy.

# Example
The CT_IBM_2021 class can be run using the script 'CTmodel_Test.m'.
The preset parameters are stored in 'params_het_CT.mat'.
